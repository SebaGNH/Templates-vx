### Installation

First of all, make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

The Vuexy [installation guide](https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-react-admin-dashboard-template/documentation/docs/development/installation) recommends to use the Yarn package manager.

After that, you need to clone this repo on your PC and checkout to the develop branch as follows:

```
git clone https://mkt-ing.vates.com/marketing/mkt-frontend
cd mkt-frontend
git checkout develop
```

Once inside the project directory, execute the following command to install all dependencies:

```
# For Yarn (Highly Recommended)
yarn

# For npm
npm install --force --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then, to run the dev server:

```
# For Yarn
yarn start

# For npm
npm run start
```

This should find some output in the console as below:

Head to your internet explorer of preference and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
